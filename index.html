        <h1>What are the Sustainable Development Goals?</h1>
        <h3>Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without
            compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</h3>
        <h3>
            The 17 SDGs are integrated they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and
            that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
            <h3>
                <h3>
                    Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are
                    designed
                    to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to
                    achieve
                    the SDGs in every context.

        <h1>Theme of Sustainable Development Goals 2023?</h1>
        <h3>
            The theme for the 2023 Forum is: “Science, technology and innovation for accelerating the recovery from
            the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
            Development at all levels”
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The 2023 Global Sustainable Development Report will be launched as the world approaches the half-way
            point of the 2030 Agenda and struggles to rebuild in the aftermath (or in the midst) of the COVID-19
            pandemic.

        <h1>Why Sustainable Goals matter!</h1>
        <h3>
            The beauty of the goals is that everyone can contribute, and every contribution, small or big, will make
            an impact on our world.
            <h3> In our
                industry, we have seen how the goals have shaped the business environment, and for the better.
            </h3>
            <h3>The Paris
                Agreement alone has helped open
                up US$ 23 trillion in business opportunities for emerging markets for climate-smart investments.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Working primarily in developing and transitional countries, we see the impact, both the negative impact
                of the changing environment and
                the growing inequality, but also the positive impact of the goals and how they are helping create better
                opportunities for the local
                communities.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                We have to use this momentum and keep pushing towards achieving the goals, so we can create
                a better world for us all.

    <h1>How will the Sustainable Development Goals be monitored?</h1>
      <h3>  At the global level, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets of the new agenda will be
        monitored and reviewed using a set of global indicators.
    </h3>
    <h3>The global indicator framework for Sustainable
        Development Goals was developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) and agreed
        upon at the 48th session of the United Nations Statistical Commission held in March 2017.</h3> 
        <h3>Governments will also develop their own national indicators to assist in monitoring progress made on the goals and targets.
            Chief statisticians from Member States are working on the identification of the targets with the aim to have 2 indicators for each target. will be approximately 300 indicators for all the targets. Where the targets cover cross-cutting issues, however, the number of indicators may be reduced.</h3>
            <h3>The follow-up and review process will be informed by an annual SDG Progress Report to be prepared by the Secretary-General.</h3>

        <h2> Climate change is already impacting public health, food and water security, migration, peace and security. Climate change, left unchecked, will roll back the development gains we have made over the last decades and will make further gains impossible.</h2>
        <h2> Investments in sustainable development will help address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience.</h2>
        <h2>Conversely, action on climate change will drive sustainable development.</h2>
        <h2>Tackling climate change and fostering sustainable development are two mutually reinforcing sides of the same coin; sustainable development cannot be achieved without climate action. Conversely, many of the SDGs are addressing the core drivers of climate change.</h2>

    <div class="question-answer">
    <h2>The Addis Ababa Action Agenda that came out of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development
        provided concrete policies and actions to support the implementation of the new agenda.
        Implementation and success will rely on countries’ own sustainable development policies, plans and programmes,
        and will be led by countries.</h2>
    <h2> The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be a compass for aligning countries’ plans with their global
        commitments.</h2>
    <h2> Nationally owned and country-led sustainable development strategies will require resource mobilization and
        financing strategies.</h2>
    <h2>All stakeholders: governments, civil society, the private sector, and others, are expected to contribute to the
        realisation of the new agenda.</h2>
    <h2> A revitalized global partnership at the global level is needed to support national efforts. This is recognized
        in the 2030 Agenda.</h2>
    <h2> Multi-stakeholder partnerships have been recognized as an important component of strategies that seek to
        mobilize all stakeholders around the new agenda.</h2>
